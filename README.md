# Image-Processing

A particular algorithm for a recognition is chosen based on various features or sub categories such as the limit of data process, the ability to recognize, etc.,
First attempt was done using Viola-Jones Face detection or otherwise commonly known as Haar Cascades. It is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video.
The algorithm uses edge or line detection features proposed by Viola and Jones It uses detection of line / edge features for face detection. Upon testing it was giving a score of 0.78 compared to the ground truth, it was able to detect faces with a medium size while it failed to detect a single face prominent in size.

The cluster analysis is to partition an image data set into a number of disjoint groups or clusters. It is also referred as the process of making a group of abstract objects into classes of similar objects.
Clustering code is straightforward as scikit-learn (sklearn) provides a high-level user-friendly API for implementing K-means clustering in python. The KMeans
inertia Montages of 5 clusters are as shown below, as it is evident clustering requires more tuning for better results.
